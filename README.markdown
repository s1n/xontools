# Xonotic Tools #

## Introduction ##

This is a collection of loosely related tools to do things with Xonotic or its
data. For example, this provides a tool to automate demo video conversion.

### d2v  ###

Converts Xonotic demo files to nicely compressed and widely supported video
files. This utility has a number of options, relying on Xonotic to capture
the video and a transcoder, such as mencoder, to convert the video.

Requires:

 1. perl 5.12 or later
 2. Xonotic or nexuiz
 3. transcoder, such as mencoder
